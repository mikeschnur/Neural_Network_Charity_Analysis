# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

Through Machine Learning and Neural Networks we helped to predict if applicants that were to be funded by a Charity would be successful or not.  By preprocessing the data for the use of a neural network, compiling, training and evaluating the Machine Learning model and optimizing the model we were able to get a closer look at the applicants.
